## Introduction

**Portfolio Management with Monte Carlo Simulation** is a comprehensive Python application designed to assist investors and financial analysts in managing and optimizing investment portfolios. By leveraging Monte Carlo simulations, the application provides probabilistic forecasts of portfolio performance under various market conditions, aiding in risk assessment and strategic planning.

---

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Seamless retrieval of historical stock data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculation of expected returns, volatility, and other key financial indicators.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Execution of extensive simulations to model future portfolio behavior.
- **Optimization Tools**: Functionality to optimize asset allocation based on desired risk-return profiles.
- **Visualization**: Generation of detailed plots and charts for insightful analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python package installer.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository (alternatively, you can download the ZIP file).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio_management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd portfolio_management
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     - **Windows**:

       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

     - **macOS/Linux**:

       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Execute the main script to start the application:

```bash
python -m portfolio_management.main
```

### Configuration

Customize the application by modifying parameters in `main.py`:

- **Tickers**: Adjust the list of stock symbols to analyze.
- **Date Range**: Set the `start_date` and `end_date` for historical data retrieval.
- **Simulation Parameters**: Change `num_simulations` and `time_horizon` for Monte Carlo simulations.

### Example

```python
def main():
    # Load data
    data_loader = DataLoader()
    stock_data = data_loader.load_data(
        tickers=['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'AMZN'],
        start_date='2019-01-01',
        end_date='2023-01-01'
    )

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```
